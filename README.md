## Map Integration

Using the nav-bar a user can naviagte to the maps feature. From here they can scroll or search for a destination, bring up a card with information and an option to add or remove it from their bucket list. The map has green pins to identify every location on your bucket list and blue pins to identify every location for every other app user.
